# nevadaneon_LSTA

LSTA-funded project to build Drupal front-end application for Islandora collection on Nevada Neon housed at UNLV

Christopher Church, PHD

## ----DESCRIPTION--------

### JSON API
01_jsonapi_all-signs-includes_JSON.php\
* THIS SCRIPT USES THE JSON API ENDPOINT AT THE UNLV SPECIAL COLLECTIONS TO COLLECT ALL INFORMATION ON NEON SIGNS
   * IT GRABS THE DCNODES, THE RELATED MEDIA NODES, AND THE RELATED FILE NODES AND STORES THEM IN THREE FILES (dc-nodes.json, media-nodes.json, files.json) IN JSON-OUTPUT
   * THIS SCRIPT ESSENTIALLY CACHES THE JSON RESULTS LOCALLY SO THEY CAN BE PROCESSED WITHOUT REPEAT CALLS TO THE JSON API ENDPOINT

02_json-to-csv.php
* THIS SCRIPT PROCESSES THE THREE JSON FILES CACHED FROM SCRIPT "01" ABOVE AND TRANSFORMS THE DATA INTO A CSV FILE, STORED IN CSV-OUTPUT DIRECTORY, THAT CAN BE PULLED INTO THE DRUPAL CMS USING THE FIELDS MODULE\
   * THE THREE IMAGE URL FIELDS (service, thumbnail, and original) ARE NOT ATOMIZED/NORMALIZED. THEY CONTAIN A COMMA DELIMITED LIST OF URLS OF ALL MEDIA ASSOCIATED WITH EACH DCNODE (aka sign), COLLAPSING THE RELATIONSHIPS FROM UNLV'S ISLANDORA
   * IN FEEDS, THE TAMPER MODULE WILL EXPLODE THE NON-ATOMIZED DATA IN THESE FIELDS TO POPULATE THE RELEVANT URL FIELDS
   * FEEDS WILL NEED A CONTENT TYPE WITH FIELDS ONTO WHICH THE CSV FIELDS CAN BE MAPPED

### METADATA MERGE
03_append-local-metadata.php
* THIS SCRIPT PERFORMS A DATA UNION ON THE DID (digital id) OF THE SIGNS FROM THE UNLV COLLECTION
   * EXTENSIBLE METADATA HELD BY UNR IS APPENDED TO THE DATA PULLED FROM THE JSON API
   * ALLOWS THE ADDITION OF EXTENSIBLE METADATA AS PART OF DATA FLOW, SO THAT BOTH THE UNLV COLLECTION LAYER AND THE UNR METADATA LAYERS CAN BE UPDATED AND REMERGED AS NECESSARY

### FIND LAT LON
FIND-LATLON/04_get-lat-lon.php
* THIS SCRIPT USES THE GOOGLE MAPS GEOCODE API TO GET LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES FOR THE NEON SIGNS CONTAINED IN THE UNR EXTENSIBLE METADATA TABLE
   * USES THE ADDRESS FIELD AND IF IT'S POPULATED GETS THE LAT/LON FROM GOOGLE API GEOCODE
   * STORES LAT/LON IF THE ROW DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE DATA


## ----NOTES TO SELF------

### *ISSUES TO RESOLVE*
1. (RESOLVED) The images associated with each dc_content node do not distinguish between Thumbnails, Full-sized Derivatives, and Originals (only distinction is in filename and path and not the metadata itself) -> when pulling images out of the JSON API to use in application layer, some are large and some a small thumbnails
2. (RESOLVED) Currently caching a local copy of the JSON API results pulled through custom PHP -> needs to use multiple API calls to get the URIs of the files associated with each dc_content node in the NNN collection -> while I can pull these as includes, a secondary step associating them on UUID would still be necessary
    * PULLED THESE AS INCLUDES AND THEN PROCESSED UNR SERVER-SIDE, CALLS DOWN FROM THOUSANDS TO 10s
3. (RESOLVED) Need to figure out best way to serve images (do I want to cache and serve locally, or just do it cross-domain) 
    * DECISION: store only URLs to the resources at UNLV and keep UNR app layer asset light
