  Wendover Will is a giant cowboy that looms large against the inky black Nevada
  sky, waving to travelers on Interstate-80 pointing to the last gambling stop
  before the Utah border. The neon sign is the first glittering sight you see
  when you enter Nevada and the last when you leave. Underneath Will’s red
  cowboy boots and silver spurs the sign reads, “Where the West Begins,” letting
  people know that they’re in Nevada, land of gambling, drinking, wide open
  country--and neon. Wendover Will is a classic cowboy decked out with a hat,
  bandana, belt buckle, gun belt and six shooter, and boots. Standing on
  Nevada’s eastern border, Wendover Will represents the mythos of the American
  West. He harkens back to the days of the Wild West, while also representing
  the glitzy casino culture that still permeates the state. Wendover Will,
  erected in 1952, is not the only cowboy of his kind in Nevada, he actually has
  two “twin” brothers in Las Vegas and Laughlin.&nbsp;

  Vegas Vic was the first larger than life neon cowboy in Nevada, Wendover Will
  the second. Thomas Young, founder of the Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO)
  in Nevada, designed the neon version of Vegas Vic, mascot of the Pioneer Club
  in Las Vegas, which was installed for $90,000 in 1951 on the corner of First
  and Fremont streets. Vegas Vic already existed in illustrated form, mainly on
  postcards sent out to advertise for the Pioneer Club. The mascot was created
  to draw in visitors and was so popular that the owners of the club
  commissioned YESCO to bring Vegas Vic to life in neon form. The neon cowboy
  was complete with a moving mechanical arm and cigarette and a recorded voice
  that boomed, “Howdy Podner!” the same greeting printed on the postcards with
  the original Vegas Vic, every 15 minutes.

  Vegas Vic’s arm stopped moving in 1991 and his voice stopped in 2006. When the
  Pioneer Club closed in 1995 and Vegas Vic looked like a true weathered cowboy,
  the Neon Museum offered to repair and maintain the sign if the owner paid for
  the electricity bill. The proposal stipulated that the sign would remain under
  the ownership of the building owner but if the building was sold it would
  become property of the Neon Museum. Ultimately the owner declined the offer
  and repaired the sign themselves. After the Pioneer Club closed a souvenir
  shop took its place. His voice stopped in 2006, but Vegas Vic still stands
  tall greeting passerby with his cigarette grin, an iconic mainstay of Las
  Vegas even as it continually shifts and changes. According to company lore,
  Thomas Young lost money on Vegas Vic and went looking for another location for
  a neon cowboy where he could make money, eventually settling on Wendover--thus
  Wendover Will was born.

  Thirty years passed between the birth of Vegas Vic and the arrival of the
  third colossal neon cowboy in Nevada, River Rick. He stands outside the Nevada
  Pioneer Hotel and Gambling Hall in Laughlin, Nevada and was erected in 1981.
  River Rick is considered to be the twin of Vegas Vic--he is essentially the
  same design with a few minute differences. Located on the banks of the
  Colorado River, the Pioneer Hotel washe sister property of the Pioneer Club.
  The owner, Margaret Elardi, commissioned YESCO, the same makers of Vegas Vic,
  to build River Rick for $1.5 million in 1981. Presumably she wanted River Rick
  to be strikingly similar to Vegas Vic to keep the same old-timey western
  aesthetic as the Pioneer Club, banking on the popularity of Vegas Vic to
  attract visitors to the Pioneer Hotel in Laughlin.

  Though times have changed, neon has gone in and out of style many times, all
  three of Nevada’s giant neon cowboys are still standing, greeting travelers
  and locals alike. They may be dated and in need of frequent repairs, but these
  idiosyncratic cowboys will hopefully stay in place because they are historic
  Nevada landmarks that represent the state in all its western, neon glory.
